Build for Linux
If you prefer to compile your own binary files, then you need the developer packages:

Ubuntu/Debian:
 sudo apt-get install git qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev
   libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev
   libssl-dev libdb++-dev libqrencode-dev
   
If you have an error installing qt4-qmake (Arises on Ubuntu 14.04.2 and possibly in other versions)
libcheese-gtk23 : Depends: libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 (>= 0.91.8) but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: libcogl15 (>= 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed
libcheese7 : Depends: libclutter-gst-2.0-0 (>= 0.10.0) but it is not going to be installed
             Depends: gstreamer1.0-clutter but it is not going to be installed
libclutter-1.0-0 : Depends: libcogl-pango15 (>= 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed
                   Depends: libcogl15 (>= 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed

Then enter

sudo apt-get install  libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0  xserver-xorg-input-all

openSUSE (verified on version 13.2):
 sudo zypper install git gcc gcc-c++ libqt4-devel boost-devel libopenssl-devel libdb-4_8-devel libqrencode3

After the installation was completed, you can clone the XP repository:

 git clone https://github.com/XP-project/XP.git

and finally, compile your client:

 cd XP
 qmake USE_O3=1 USE_ASM=1 (if you want to use LevelDB include USE_LEVELDB=1)  
 make
 cd src
 make -f makefile.unix USE_O3=1 USE_ASM=1 (again, if using LevelDB include USE_LEVELDB=1) 
 strip XPd      

The commands above compile binary files with dynamic linking, if you want with static linking and your distribution contains static libraries (.a, not .so), then add:
-in the qmake command:
 RELEASE=1         
-in the make -f makefile.unix command:
 STATIC=1

If you want to reduce the size of binary files,
1) Go to the website http://upx.sourceforge.net/#downloadupx
2) Download the program according to your system
3) Unpack the program in a folder with binary XP files.
4) Enter in the terminal:
  ./upx -9 XPd
  then
  ./upx -9 XP-qt
